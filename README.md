### Adjusting Game settings
I have developes this on Raspberry. I believe computers with more resources will run the game faster. 
If game speed is not reasonable or you just wan't to change it for any reason - you can!
In settings.py file you can change the gameplay settings like:
-Ship speed
-Bullet speed
-Amount of bullets
-Alien speed
-etc
